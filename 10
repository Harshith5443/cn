EXPERIMENT NO:7 
TITLE: CONGESTION CONTROL USING LEAKY BUCKET ALGORITHM 
Algorithm: 
1. Read The Data For Packets 
2. Read The Queue Size 
3. Divide the Data into Packets 
4. Assign the random Propagation delays for each packets to input into the bucket (input_packet). 
5. Wlile((Clock++<5*total_packets) and (out_packets< total_paclets)) 
a. if (clock == input_packet) 
i. insert into Queue 
b. if (clock % 5 == 0 ) 
i. Remove paclet from Queue 
6. END

OUTPUT: 
 
Enter the bucket size and output rate(both in MB):30 
10 
Enter the number of input lines 
3 
Enter input packet rate of 3 lines 
5 
20 
15 
Enter the number of iterations 
2 
Iteration 1 
Input from line 1 with rate 5 is added to the bucket 
Current bucket size(Mb) is 5 
Input from line 2 with rate 20 is added to the bucket 
Current bucket size(Mb) is 25 
Input from line 3 with rate 15 is thrown out of bucket 
Current bucket size(Mb)is 25 --------------------------------- 
packet sent to output line at rate 10 
 Current bucket size(Mb)is 15 
Iteration 2 
Input from line 1 with rate 5 is added to the bucket 
Current bucket size(Mb) is 20 
Input from line 2 with rate 20 is thrown out of bucket 
Current bucket size(Mb)is 20 
Input from line 3 with rate 15 is thrown out of bucket 
Current bucket size(Mb)is 20 --------------------------------- 
packet sent to output line at rate 10 
Current bucket size(Mb)is 10
